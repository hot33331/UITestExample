# UI Test Example

This project should demonstrate how to use Xamarin UITests using a small weather app

## Weather API

I used the weather api OpenWeather in my project. In order to make the api calls you have to get an api key from https://openweathermap.org/api and insert it in the WeatherService.cs - Without the key the app will always claim that the entered city does not exist.

Using OpenWeather is free (for everything I used here) and it does not take long to get the api key ;)

Please make sure to click the link in the confirmation mail you get when you set up your OpenWeather account. Otherwise your API Keys will not work and you still get the error that your city does not exist.
