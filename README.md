# UI Test Example

This project should demonstrate how to use Xamarin UITests using a small weather app

## Weather API

I used the weather api OpenWeather in my project. In order to make the api calls you have to get an api key from https://openweathermap.org/api and insert it in the WeatherService.cs - Without the key the app will always claim that the entered city does not exist.

Using OpenWeather is free (for everything I used here) and it does not take long to get the api key ;)
